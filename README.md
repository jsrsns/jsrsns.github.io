Syntax
When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks.
Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
Include one space after `:` for each declaration.
Each declaration should appear on its own line.
End all declarations with a semi-colon.
Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma.
Don't prefix property values of color parameters with a leading zero (e.g. `.5` instead of `0.5` and `-.5px` instead of `-0.5px`).
Lowercase all hex values (e.g. `#fff`).
Use shorthand hex values when available (e.g. `#fff` instead of `#ffffff`).
Avoid specifying units for zero values (e.g. `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px`).
